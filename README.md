## Motivation
    The goal behind this project is too display my ablitiy to use OOP(object oriented programming).
    This particualar creation display the members of a team that are created from the command line.
    Then generates a html page displaying the members of the team.
    A manger, engineer, and a intern. Each has it own unquie setup or displayformat that.
    So the cards displaying the teams information are simaluar but the information with inthe cards are different.
    Another goal in this project was to write out test in order to test the functionaitlity of the files in the lib folder.

## Problems
    I ran into a few problems when creating this project.
    One of the problems i had ran into dealt with inquirer but it wasnt a major problem it was spelling as one of the issues.
    As trivial as they may seem and the other problem I was having was the order in which I had things wrote in my index.js. that order problem I just mentioned seemed to had been affecting how my inquirer questions would display. I was struggling to get my question to populate in general the start question would appear an you could select manager, engineer, interen then nothing and I was ready to pull what little hair i have out of my head. Seeking outside help they pointed my order and misspellings which were holding me back.

    Also i ran into a slight problem the test due me more so because i had been trying to use something other then toEqual in my test but that didnt work so well. And due to time constrant I went with the o'reliable toEqual method in my test. I had looked up other methods but I wasn't getting the results I had beeen aiming for which discouraged me from trying out different methods in my test scripts.

## What I learned
    Well I learend in short way of saying it is I was my own worst enemey. I realized how very important my spelling is and the order of what I want to happen is. I learned about other methods to use in my testing, which truthly I'll have to gain more practice with because I don't like the idea of only being successful in one way of getting the results from a test.

## Video Link
     Here i have placed a video showing me running the test and the app working on properly through the command line.
